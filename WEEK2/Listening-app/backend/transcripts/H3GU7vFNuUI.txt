hon Medina hi everybody I'm Medina
welcome to sili 101.com
the fastest easiest and most fun way to
learn Swahili in the last lesson we
learned how to thank people by saying
Asante in this lesson
we learn some of the most common
greetings used in Kenya otari are you
ready toan so let's get started the most
commonly used informal greeting is
habari
habari habari means hi or hello we use
it when we meet people we can use this
greeting with friends or relatives but
also with people we don't know we used
this phrase in lesson one do you
remember and do you remember what the
formal way of greting people is
shik
Sho do you also remember that habari can
be used both in formal and Casual
settings during the evening we say
Hab Johny is Swahili for evening so
habar jouri means good evening habari
and habar journey are used when we meet
someone but when we leave we don't say
these greetings again instead when
living in both formal and informal
situations Kenyan people say queri
queri queri means goodbye finally in
soili we have an expression meaning see
you soon that can be considered both
formal and informal to
now you can greet people in many
different ways in Swahili let's review
them all again when greeting someone in
an informal way remember to say habari
when greeting someone in a formal
situation you say shik when living in
either a formal or informal situation
say to it's easy isn't it now it's time
for Medina's insights in formal
situations Kenyans commonly greet each
other by shaking hands but if we meet
someone we are very friendly with we hug
each other don't be afraid to do it with
your Kenyan friends it's
normal in the next lesson we learn the
meaning of the
phrase do you already know it I'll be
waiting with the answer in our
next until then
