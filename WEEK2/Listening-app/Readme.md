# Language Listening App - Technical Domain Knowledge

## Technical Uncertainties and Solutions

### 1. Text-to-Speech Model Selection for Swahili

- **Challenge**: Finding appropriate TTS models for low-resource languages like Swahili
- **Solution**: Implemented a hybrid approach using:
  - Facebook's MMS-TTS (Massively Multilingual Speech) model
  - Microsoft's SpeechT5 as a fallback option
  - Custom speaker embeddings for voice variety

### 2. Symlink Limitations in Hugging Face Hub on Windows

When utilizing the Hugging Face Hub on Windows platforms, users may encounter warnings related to the creation of symbolic links (symlinks). This stems from the fact that, by default, the Hugging Face Hub's caching system employs symlinks to efficiently manage storage and avoid file duplication.

**Implications:**

- **Increased Disk Usage:** Without symlink support, identical files may be stored multiple times
- **Performance Considerations:** The lack of symlinks can affect file handling efficiency

### 3. Audio Generation Pipeline Architecture

- **Components**:
  - Question parsing and validation
  - Text-to-speech generation with multiple service options
  - Audio file management and combination
  - Temporary file handling for generated audio segments

### 4. Vector Store Implementation for Question Similarity

- Using ChromaDB for efficient similarity search
- Multilingual sentence transformers for Swahili text embeddings
- Question template matching and generation

### 5. Model Compatibility and Version Management

- **Challenges**:
  - Python version compatibility (3.9-3.11 for TTS libraries)
  - Transformers library version dependencies
  - Model loading and memory management
- **Solutions**:
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms
  - Lazy loading of models
  - Clear error handling and logging

## Key Technical Learnings

1. **Audio Processing**:

   - Managing audio file formats and concatenation
   - Handling different sampling rates and audio quality
   - Implementing pause generation between speech segments

2. **Language Processing**:

   - Swahili text normalization and cleaning
   - Speaker gender detection and voice assignment
   - Conversation structure parsing and validation

3. **System Architecture**:

   - Separation of concerns between frontend and backend
   - Efficient state management in Streamlit
   - File system handling for audio storage

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful fallbacks for model loading
   - Cleanup of temporary files
   - User-friendly error messages

## Future Considerations

1. **Model Optimization**:

   - Investigate fine-tuning options for Swahili
   - Explore lightweight alternatives for resource-constrained environments
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently used audio segments

2. **Scalability**:

   - Consider containerization for deployment
   - Implement batch processing for audio generation
   - Optimize memory usage for large-scale usage

3. **User Experience**:
   - Add progress indicators for long-running operations
   - Implement audio preprocessing for consistent volume levels
   - Add support for more African languages

This knowledge base represents the technical uncertainties encountered and resolved during the development of the Language Listening App, specifically focused on Swahili language learning.
