# Chat Completion Microservice with Streaming Response

## Overview
This project demonstrates a microservice architecture where a Python service accepts chat completion requests and forwards them to a remote large language model (LLM) service. The service returns a streaming response broken into chunks (as shown by the curl output). The entire system is containerized using Docker Compose.

## How It Works
- **Service Orchestration:**  
  The Python code defines an `ExampleService` class that sets up a local microservice (exposing an endpoint such as `/v1/example-service`) and integrates with a remote LLM service. The orchestrator (`ServiceOrchestrator`) manages the remote service calls.
  
- **Request Handling:**  
  When a POST request is made (e.g., via curl to `http://localhost:8008/api/generate`), the service:
  - Formats the request (choosing a default model like `"llama3.2:1b"` if none is provided).
  - Forwards the request to the LLM service endpoint (e.g., `/v1/chat/completions`).
  - Asynchronously collects streaming chunks of the response.
  
- **Streaming Response:**  
  The response is sent back in multiple JSON fragments, each representing a portion of the generated text. This incremental delivery is useful for real-time feedback and helps manage longer responses.

- **Docker & VS Integration:**  
  Running on Windows with Docker Desktop and the Visual Studio Docker extension, environment variables and networking (like setting the host IP and ports) are automatically managed. This streamlined deployment means you didn’t need to manually retrieve your IP or adjust configuration—the extension handles it.

## Why It Works
- **Microservice Architecture:**  
  By splitting the task between a local orchestrating service and a remote LLM service, the solution is modular and scalable. The orchestrator abstracts away the complexity of remote communication.
  
- **Asynchronous Processing:**  
  The use of asynchronous handling allows the service to process streamed data efficiently. This is critical for handling responses in near-real time.
  
- **Containerized Environment:**  
  Docker Compose provides a consistent environment that isolates dependencies and networking. Docker Desktop with the VS extension simplifies the setup on Windows, automatically supplying necessary environment configurations.
  
- **Automatic Environment Management:**  
  Since the Visual Studio Docker extension manages environment variables and network settings, the setup becomes almost “plug-and-play.” This reduces manual overhead and potential errors in configuration.

## Achievement So Far
- **Successful Streaming Response:**  
  The curl output shows that the service successfully receives and outputs the response in multiple fragments (e.g., "The", " sky", " appears", etc.), eventually constructing a full answer. This confirms that the service correctly orchestrates the request to the LLM and processes its streamed reply.
  
- **Simplified Deployment on Windows:**  
  Leveraging Docker Desktop and the VS extension on Windows allowed you to bypass manual IP and environment variable configuration. This smooth integration validates your approach for rapid development and testing.
  
- **Modular and Extendable Design:**  
  The code is structured to easily add more remote services (e.g., an embedding service, if needed), and the use of typed request/response protocols ensures clarity in API design. This positions the project well for future expansion or integration into larger systems.
