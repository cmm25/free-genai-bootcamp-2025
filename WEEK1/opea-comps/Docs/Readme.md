## 2. Architecture Layers

### BaseService

**Purpose:**  
Acts as the foundational class providing abstract methods and essential functionalities required by all service implementations.

**Key Features:**
- **Abstract Functions:** Methods that must be overridden to implement custom initialization, execution, and shutdown procedures.
- **Core Utilities:** Integrated logging, error handling, and configuration management.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Provides hooks for service startup and graceful shutdown, ensuring that resources are properly managed.

**Impact:**  
This layer standardizes common behaviors, ensuring consistency and reliability across all derived services.

---

### HTTPService

**Purpose:**  
Extends BaseService to create a web-accessible interface using FastAPI, thereby transforming the service into an API endpoint provider.

**Key Features:**
- **FastAPI Integration:** Automatically builds a FastAPI application to handle incoming HTTP requests.
- **Uvicorn Server:** Utilizes Uvicorn as the ASGI server for optimal performance in production environments.
- **Endpoint Management:** Implements a series of standard endpoints (e.g., health checks, statistics) for consistent monitoring and diagnostics.

**Impact:**  
By abstracting the complexities of web service creation, HTTPService allows developers to focus on implementing business logic rather than boilerplate code, thereby accelerating development cycles.

---

### MicroService

**Purpose:**  
Derives from HTTPService to serve as an API gateway for specific underlying functionalities, such as language models, embedding generators, or rerankers.

**Key Features:**
- **API Gateway Role:** Exposes dedicated endpoints that interface directly with a particular service.
- **Pipeline Integration:** Can be integrated into larger orchestrated workflows, making it a vital component in complex data pipelines.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Supports both standalone operation and as part of a composite MegaService architecture.

**Impact:**  
MicroService acts as a modular building block, enabling a flexible architecture where individual services can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system.

---

## 3. Standard Endpoints

Every FastAPI application built using HTTPService includes a set of predefined endpoints to ensure operational health and diagnostic visibility:

- **`/v1/health_check`:**  
  Provides a comprehensive health status of the service. This endpoint is critical for monitoring and automated alerting in production environments.

- **`/v1/health`:**  
  Serves as an alias for `/v1/health_check`, ensuring compatibility and ease of use.

- **`/v1/statistics`:**  
  Delivers detailed performance metrics and operational statistics, facilitating real-time monitoring and performance tuning.

**Impact:**  
Standardized endpoints guarantee that all services adhere to a uniform interface for health and performance monitoring, simplifying maintenance and support processes across distributed systems.

## 4. MicroService vs. MegaService

### MicroService Definition Example

A microservice encapsulates a distinct functionality. For example, defining a Language Model (LLM) service might look like this:

```python
llm = MicroService(
    name="llm",
    host=LLM_SERVER_HOST_IP,
    port=LLM_SERVER_PORT,
    endpoint="/v1/chat/completions",
    use_remote_service=True,
    service_type=ServiceType.LLM,
    service_role=ServiceRoleType.MICROSERVICE,
)
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Identification:**  
  The service is clearly identified by its name and endpoint.
- **Service Type:**  
  The `service_type` parameter selects the role from a predefined set (e.g., LLM, EMBEDDING, RETRIEVER) specified in the system’s constants.
- **Role Specification:**  
  Marked as `MICROSERVICE` to denote it operates as a self-contained unit within the overall architecture.

**Impact:**  
This design ensures that each microservice is specialized and independently deployable, fostering modularity and reducing interdependencies.

---

### MegaService Definition Example

A MegaService aggregates multiple microservices, exposing a unified API that represents a composite functionality. For instance:

```python
self.endpoint = "/v1/example-service"
self.service = MicroService(
    self.__class__.__name__,
    service_role=ServiceRoleType.MEGASERVICE,
    host=self.host,
    port=self.port,
    endpoint=self.endpoint,
    input_datatype=ChatCompletionRequest,
    output_datatype=ChatCompletionResponse,
)
self.service.add_route(self.endpoint, self.handle_request, methods=["POST"])
self.service.start()
```

**Key Considerations:**
- **Aggregation:**  
  Multiple microservices are combined to offer a comprehensive service through a single endpoint.
- **Role Specification:**  
  The `service_role` is set to `MEGASERVICE`, clearly indicating its composite nature.
- **Data Type Enforcement:**  
  Explicitly defines input and output data types, ensuring strong type safety and consistency.
- **Custom Routing:**  
  Provides the ability to add custom routes for complex request handling, enabling flexible external interactions.

**Impact:**  
MegaService simplifies the integration of multiple functionalities into a single, coherent interface, which is essential for building enterprise-grade applications where composite services must be exposed to external clients.

## 5. Service Orchestrator

The **ServiceOrchestrator** is the engine that integrates multiple microservices into a unified workflow through a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

**Key Features:**
- **Workflow Management:**  
  Coordinates the sequential execution of services, ensuring that the output of one service is passed as input to the next.
- **Deterministic Pipeline Configuration:**  
  The orchestration is explicitly defined using a DAG, ensuring predictable and repeatable execution flows.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:**  
  New services can be added, or existing flows can be modified without disrupting the overall pipeline.

**Workflow Definition Example:**

```python
self.megaservice.add(guardrail_in).add(embedding).add(retriever).add(rerank).add(llm)
self.megaservice.flow_to(guardrail_in, embedding)
self.megaservice.flow_to(embedding, retriever)
self.megaservice.flow_to(retriever, rerank)
self.megaservice.flow_to(rerank, llm)
```

**Impact:**  
By managing inter-service dependencies and ensuring a well-defined data flow, the ServiceOrchestrator greatly enhances the system's robustness and scalability, making it well-suited for high-performance enterprise applications.
