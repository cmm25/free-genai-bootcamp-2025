            - BAD: Vocabulary table missed hints on noun class behavior, reducing learning opportunities.  
            - BAD: Sentence structure over-explained the conceptual form, making it less engaging for discovery.  
            - BAD: Clues provided too many details about tense markers instead of prompting exploration.  
            - BAD: Immediate corrections were implied rather than encouraging further attempts.

            Let's break down the sentence step by step. Here's a vocabulary table to get started:

            | Swahili | English |
            |--------|---------|
            | ona    | see     |
            | mbuzi  | goats   |
            | asubuhi| morning |
            | angalia| look    |
            | bustani| garden  |
            | etu    | our     |

            Sentence structure:
            - The first part is a question involving a past action with "ona" as the verb.
            - The second part describes a continuous past action.  

            Suggested structure:
            [Verb] [Subject] [Object] [Time]?  
            [Subject] [Verb-past continuous] [Location].

            Try filling in the blanks and don't hesitate to ask for hints on tense conjugation.

            - GOOD: Vocabulary table subtly hints at noun class behavior without being explicit.  
            - GOOD: Sentence structure remains conceptual, allowing for critical thinking.  
            - GOOD: Clues prompt discovery by asking questions rather than providing direct answers.  
            - GOOD: Encourages revision rather than giving implied corrections.

            Cheatsheet:
            | Swahili | English |
            |--------|---------|
            | ona    | see     |
            | mbuzi  | goats   |
            | asubuhi| morning |
            | angalia| look    |
            | bustani| garden  |
            | etu    | our     |

            Sentence structure:
            [Verb-question] [Subject] [Object] [Time]?  
            [Subject] [Verb-past continuous] [Location].

            Considerations:
            - The first part is a yes/no question about a past action.
            - The second part describes a continuous past action involving a location.
            - Notice how "our" in Swahili requires a possessive marker.

            Possible next steps:
            - Attempt an answer.
            - Ask for hints on noun class agreement if unsure.
            - Request clues for tense markers without revealing specific forms.
            - Think critically about time phrase placement in the sentence.
